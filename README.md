# Gilded Rose starting position in Java

## File naming system

***Old.java => initial version of the file before any change

***1.java => first implementation until the "conjured" items part, before any Item class change

***2.java => second iteration: it semplifies GildedRose file by extracting children items from the main one

***3.java => first enhancement implementation

***4.java => second enhancement implementation (WIP)
